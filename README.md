# What is Nika?

Nika is an open-source operating system kernel inspired by Linux and the OSDev community, following design philosophies similar to Unix/Linux systems.

It is fully free software, allowing unrestricted modification and redistribution. Nika is designed as a platform for experimentation, low-level development, and learning about operating system internals, with a strong focus on clarity, control, and hands-on understanding of kernel development.
